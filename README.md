<!-- ### Hi there üëã -->
Full-stack developer proficient in Python and JavaScript. Currently building with React, Flask, Django, and PostgreSQL.

Writing code like someone's always about to pop over my shoulder and ask, "What's that?"

A teacher at heart, eager to learn so that I might share it with others. üßô

I've honed the subtle art of debugging by the fires of a thousand student questions; every bug I take down makes my inner child sing in triumph. Working as a coding instructor has given me a taste for code that reads as well as it performs, and I find continual joy in the reality that the "languages" part of "coding languages" is not just a metaphor.
