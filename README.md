<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

Ever since I changed the language setting on my phone to Spanish 5 years ago, I've dreamt of one day mastering as many of the world's languages as I can in this life that I have. I didn't know then that these aspirations would soon grow beyond love of the natural languages into a passion for languages formal and artificial.

Sure, I'm not yet one of those YouTubeTikTokInstagram hyperpolyglot sensations (took my time with Spanish â€” and it paid off), but I can say now that, just as I might place images and ideas in the mind of another through my mother and father tongues, so too can I make concrete in virtual space ideas and experiences with JavaScript and Python.

I used to teach kids to write in the active voice and keep their comma-separated lists parallel. Now, I've been taught and continue to learn to write DRY and keep my APIs RESTful.

The comma-separated lists are still there, funnily enough.
